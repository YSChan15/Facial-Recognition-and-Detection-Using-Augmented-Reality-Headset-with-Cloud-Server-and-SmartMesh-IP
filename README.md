## Introduction 
- This is a senior design project at St. Cloud State University for Fall 2023 - Spring 2024

- Advisor: Dr. Zheng 

- Commitee: Dr. Hossain, Dr. Cavalcanti
  
- Group members: Brycen Hillukka, Yu Sheng Chan, Hayden Scott, Brandon Wieberdink 

> This project is sponsored by a grant from the Emerson corporation.

**A senior design capstone project. The group members divided the work as follows:**

- Brycen developed all the facial recognition cloud server programs and helped Yu Sheng develop the initial version of both of his systems.

- Yu Sheng developed the Arduino measuring system as well as the program for the Augmented Reality (AR) headset.

- Hayden developed/modified the Wireless Sensor Network with the custom network manager.

- Brandon developed the curved LiDAR PCB and upgraded the Wireless Sensor Network PCB which included adding a custom network manager.


## Abstract
- The objective of this project is to design and develop an intelligent position estimation and sharing system for battlefields, using Augmented Reality (AR), LiDAR, GPS, electric compass, gyroscope, and a wireless sensor network.
 
- The ultimate device will be used by a locator to identify adversaries, locate their positions, and share the information to fellow soldiers in the area. 

- The prototype system uses the AR headset to capture the facial, distance, position, and other information and upload it to a cloud server for facial recognition. 

- The communication link is through a cellular phone system or satellite communication. LiDAR, GPS, electric compass, and gyroscopic sensors are used to estimate an enemy’s distance and location. The information of the identified adversaries are sent to other soldiers in the related area of the battlefield by using the wireless sensor network, SmartMesh IP. 

- The system is battery-powered and uses solar panels for recharging, making it self-sustaining and suitable for deployment in remote locations. The use of SmartMesh IP technology allows for efficient and reliable communication between the central hub and the sensors, even in challenging environments. This wireless sensor network is ideal for decentralized information distribution and has the potential to provide valuable insights and enable informed decision-making in remote combat areas where traditional internet connectivity may not be available. This project completes the first-generation system.
